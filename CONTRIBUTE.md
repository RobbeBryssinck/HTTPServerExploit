* Make a fork of the project.
* Make use of feature branches using the format "feature-featureName".
* Adhere to the C# standard coding conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
* Make pull requests to submit changes.

## Development environment
To set up the development environment for the back end applications, please install Visual Studio with the following components:
* ASP.NET
* .NET Core 3.1.

The front-end of the web application does not require any special dependencies, since this environment is always ran through Docker, which pulls the relevant dependencies. If, for some reason, you would like to run the web application locally, please install NodeJS.

# Coding guidelines
As mentioned before, please adhere to the C# standard coding conventions. Apart from that, the only custom coding convention that applies to this code base is to make minimal use of the "auto" keyword.
