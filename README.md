# RobNet
## Disclaimer
This is a software engineering project for school, not a cyber security project. The goal of this project was to make a distributed system with the microservices pattern. The "malware" is not realistic, and that is on purpose.

## RobNet
This application allows their users to add bots to their botnet and control those bots from a web application. The application handles giving out the commands, as long as the bot client is installed on the bots.

## Installation
This project is containerized in Docker and deployable with docker-compose. Clone the git repository, navigate to the "src" directory in the command line, and type "docker-compose up". The web application will be running at "localhost:3001".
