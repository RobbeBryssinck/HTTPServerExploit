# RobNet
## Disclaimer
This is a software engineering project for school, not a cyber security project. The goal of this project was to make a distributed system with the microservices pattern. The "malware" is not realistic, and that is on purpose.

## RobNet
This application allows their users to add bots to their botnet and control those bots from a web application. The application handles giving out the commands, as long as the bot client is installed on the bots.

## Dependencies
To run the project, the target machine must have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

## Installation
Make sure Docker is running. If it is, you can start the project by executing the start up script in the root directory of the project, "StartProject.bat".

## Development
To set up the development environment, see CONTRIBUTE.md.
